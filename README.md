# SLNSW Corporate Icon Library

This icon library was built to work with [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/). It can
be updated by importing the `selection.json` file as a new project, and then
exporting it out when changes have been made.

* Georgina Carberry
* Geoffrey Roberts
* Colin Watson
* Justine Pogroske
